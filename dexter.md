# Creating Facebook Messenger bots with Dexter

[Dexter](https://rundexter.com) is a platform for creating bots (you can [find a list of alternatives on my bookmarks for 'bots+tools'](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:bots+tools)). In this tutorial I'll explain how to create a basic Facebook Messenger bot using Dexter, and some ideas for developing it further.

Before you begin, you will need to do the following:

* Register for a free account with Dexter (click on '*Make your first bot*' or '*Sign in*')
* Create a [Facebook Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#developer-account)

Dexter has a [quick start guide](http://docs.rundexter.com/quick-start/) which walks you through the process of creating a basic bot, along with various other guides to particular aspects of bot creation along the left hand navigation. Those guides will be very useful to refer to as you continue. This tutorial is going to take some aspects of those and apply them to a journalistic context.

## Create your first bot

Make sure you are logged into Dexter and at the page [rundexter.com/bot](https://rundexter.com/bot). 

Click the **New Bot** button on the left hand side, and give your bot a name, like 'eastsidebot' or 'crimebot'.
